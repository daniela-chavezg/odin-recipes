        <h2>An extra-easy wonderfully refreshing cream cheese and mixed fruit pie.</h2>
        <p>The fruit pie was one of the Air Nomads' most popular desserts. The monks sold them for one silver piece each and donated the profits to charity. According to Monk Gyatso, the secret to the pie's taste was the gooey filling, and they came in four distinct colors: orange, purple, red, and yellow.</p>
